Welcome to Progress Printer's documentation!
============================================

**ProgressPrinter** is a small and simple to use library that helps
you to print the state of a progressing action (e.g. a file download
or parsing files line by line) graphically to the console or terminal.
At the moment only *progress bars* are supported but I plan to add more soon.

*Simple Example:*
::

   pb = ProgressBar(100, '%', pre='Downloading file', post='Download finished', length=25)
   pb.print_progress()  # Prints the initial empty progress bar
   for percent in range(1, 101):
      pb1.print_progress(percent)
      sleep(0.15)

*Output:*
::
   Downloading file
   [========================>] - Finished 100 % of 100 %
   Download finished
